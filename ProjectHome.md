# Xenowar #
Xenowar (working title was "UFO Attack") is a turn based strategy game for Win32 and Android OS (version 2.1 or higher.)

Xenowar is influenced by X-COM, the iPhone and Android development, and casual games. It's been changing as it develops to be comfortable on the mobile platform. The project started out as an experiment to understand mobile GPUs on a mobile phone, and just became too interesting to not keep playing with.

This is the development site (although some docs are hosted here.) If you want the game site, check out: http://xenowar.net. There you can find the [forum](http://xenowar.net/forum/) with the latest news and [download](http://xenowar.net/) the game.

If you are interested in how to play, check out the [wiki](http://xenowar.wikispaces.com/).

The wiki page at this site covers the internals of the game, and future development.
