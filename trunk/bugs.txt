Demo bugs:
- explosive weapons
- fire - flammability
- weapon (in)accuracy
- center on selected unit (w/ scrolling)
- reaction fire
- tu in character screen

Wait
- weird delay when map objects destroyed
- need correct colors in RenderWeapon()
- melee weapons

FIXED
- on object destroyed, re-calc visibility
- remove double delay on weapon blasts
- always fires primary weapon
