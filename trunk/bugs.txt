- Pop location should never fail. (fixed enough.)
- Art: help notes
- Remove plants, go to trees.

- 'next' by proximity
- selection metaphor 
	- next/prev, click dest, click to fire?
	- unit icons? click to select in UI?
- gameplay
	- crouching?
	- rotation?
- End game at any point (instead of just on terran end-turn)
- Sounds
- map generation, tile rotation (YAY! - fixed coordinate system, fixed rotation...)
- Art: fix alien doors
- different maps
- proportional font
- center on hit unit
- AI: guard behavior
- Armor. Affects hp. Can't change in tactical view.
- AI: some random scout motion
- rework low ammo weapons, fix test game
- explosion not causing FoW update ???
- Couldn't figure out crosshair: UI wasn't clear (rely on help)

- can't see who is selected / Hard to tell who the currently selected unit is.
- Highlight looks stupid / intergrated button highlight (dark or light selected??)

- account for aliens having better night vision in CalcVisibilityRay
- all aliens should be rank0 
- Alien HP too high / damage too low. Normalize traits.

FIXED [test #1]
- center on selected unit (w/ scrolling?)
- reaction fire probability
- weapon (in)accuracy
- doors
- map destruction isn't causing re-vis and reaction.
- first unit in first slot doesn't seem to do damage correctly with rocket
- sort out when to clear / process Events
- reaction fire
- sort out CalcVis vs. CalcAllVis.
- fire - flammability
- smoke from explosive weapons
- smoke and fire effect visibility
- explosive weapons
- on object destroyed, re-calc visibility
- remove double delay on weapon blasts
- always fires primary weapon
- weird delay when map objects destroyed
- optimize CalcUnitVisibility() to look at a cone.
- map: check "view bounds" before invalidating a unit.

Deferred/Cancelled
- melee weapons
- tu in character screen
- simultaneous shots
- Sounds: better sounds, latency
- Gameplay: doors are death traps if guarded...blow up doors?

Notes w/ Jeff:
- Inventory screen: which is ground, which is inventory?
	- equipped: move to top
	- label: active vs. pack
	- label: ground vs. pack
- Idea Pistol:
	- infinite ammo (fairly weak)
	- flare to AR-2
- Bug: stuff on ground didn't get saved (!!??)
- Inventory: filter on? Something to indicate tabs??
