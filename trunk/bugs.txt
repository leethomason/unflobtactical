
Issues:
- can't see who is selected
- Hard to tell who the currently selected unit is.
- showing too many particles (hide in FoW)
- rework low ammo weapons, fix test game
- explosion not causing FoW update ???
- AI: guard behavior
- Armor. Affects hp. Can't change in tactical view.
- center on hit unit
- Pinching doesn't feel right
- phat loot / edge of map / exploration
- tap accuracy
- need correct colors in RenderWeapon()
- check math (again) in PushShootAction()
- map generation
- different maps
- tutorial notes
- new turn generation
- Couldn't figure out crosshair: UI wasn't clear
- Highlight looks stupid / intergrated button highlight (dark or light selected??)
- Sounds
- Art: better human models
- Art: color scheme 2.0
- Art: better alien models
- Art: missing weapon models
- unconscious
- mission types: landing
- mission types: crash
- mission types: terror
- mission types: big ufos
- mission types: base
- performance: AI/Alien turn pauses

TBD:
- Center engine view on clip, not full screen
- Reconsider when reaction fire occurs. And probability.
- performance: AI/Alien turn pauses


FIXED [test #2]
- UI covers up target icons
- Fix: added distance check. explosive weapons should not reaction fire?? Or check for line of sight?
- move controls to their own bar.
- move clip to engine	
- reconsider button placement
- scaling
- separate UI
- rework low ammo weapons, fix test game
- explosive weapons should not reaction fire?? Or check for line of sight?
- fix issue with 2 aliens on same tile...
- don't allow moving off of edge of map
- account for aliens having better night vision in CalcVisibilityRay
- all aliens should be rank0 
- Alien HP too high / damage too low. Normalize traits.
- need victory / defeat screen
- call SetFogOfWar less (New visibility class defers as much calculation as possible)
- AI: moves too close
- better weapon accuracy calibration
- alien turn indicator
- AI: aliens not following LKP
- FoW not updating properly when moving? or pausing incorrect?
- Aliens come back to life! Or at least look that way.
- crates could be more descriptive in their images...
- hit point bar
- disable controls during alien turn

FIXED [test #1]
- center on selected unit (w/ scrolling?)
- reaction fire probability
- weapon (in)accuracy
- doors
- map destruction isn't causing re-vis and reaction.
- first unit in first slot doesn't seem to do damage correctly with rocket
- sort out when to clear / process Events
- reaction fire
- sort out CalcVis vs. CalcAllVis.
- fire - flammability
- smoke from explosive weapons
- smoke and fire effect visibility
- explosive weapons
- on object destroyed, re-calc visibility
- remove double delay on weapon blasts
- always fires primary weapon
- weird delay when map objects destroyed
- optimize CalcUnitVisibility() to look at a cone.
- map: check "view bounds" before invalidating a unit.

Deferred/Cancelled
- melee weapons
- tu in character screen
