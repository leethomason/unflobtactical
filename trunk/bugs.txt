BUGS:
- sort out when to clear / process Events
- reaction fire
- first unit in first slot doesn't seem to do damage correctly with rocket
- weapon (in)accuracy
- center on selected unit (w/ scrolling?)
- tu in character screen
- doors

WAIT
- weird delay when map objects destroyed
- need correct colors in RenderWeapon()
- melee weapons
- optimize CalcUnitVisibility() to look at a cone.
- map: check "view bounds" before invalidating a unit.

FIXED
- sort out CalcVis vs. CalcAllVis.
- fire - flammability
- smoke from explosive weapons
- smoke and fire effect visibility
- explosive weapons
- on object destroyed, re-calc visibility
- remove double delay on weapon blasts
- always fires primary weapon
