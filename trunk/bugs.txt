- map generation
- different maps
- tutorial notes

FIXED [test #2]
- Aliens come back to life! Or at least look that way.

FIXED [test #1]
- center on selected unit (w/ scrolling?)
- reaction fire probability
- weapon (in)accuracy
- doors
- map destruction isn't causing re-vis and reaction.
- first unit in first slot doesn't seem to do damage correctly with rocket
- sort out when to clear / process Events
- reaction fire
- sort out CalcVis vs. CalcAllVis.
- fire - flammability
- smoke from explosive weapons
- smoke and fire effect visibility
- explosive weapons
- on object destroyed, re-calc visibility
- remove double delay on weapon blasts
- always fires primary weapon
- weird delay when map objects destroyed
- optimize CalcUnitVisibility() to look at a cone.
- map: check "view bounds" before invalidating a unit.

Deferred/Cancelled
- melee weapons
- tu in character screen
