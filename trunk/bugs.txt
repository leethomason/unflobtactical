

Issues:
- Aliens come back to life! Or at least look that way.
- Pinching doesn't feel right
- next turn indicator
- reconsider button placement
- phat loot / edge of map / exploration
- hit point bar
- Alien HP too high / damage too low
- better weapon accuracy calibration
- tap accuracy
- need correct colors in RenderWeapon()
- call SetFogOfWar less
- check math (again) in PushShootAction()
- map generation
- different maps
- tutorial notes
- new turn generation
- Couldn't figure out crosshair: UI wasn't clear
- Highlight looks stupid
- need victory / defeat screen


FIXED
- center on selected unit (w/ scrolling?)
- reaction fire probability
- weapon (in)accuracy
- doors
- map destruction isn't causing re-vis and reaction.
- first unit in first slot doesn't seem to do damage correctly with rocket
- sort out when to clear / process Events
- reaction fire
- sort out CalcVis vs. CalcAllVis.
- fire - flammability
- smoke from explosive weapons
- smoke and fire effect visibility
- explosive weapons
- on object destroyed, re-calc visibility
- remove double delay on weapon blasts
- always fires primary weapon
- weird delay when map objects destroyed
- optimize CalcUnitVisibility() to look at a cone.
- map: check "view bounds" before invalidating a unit.

Deferred/Cancelled
- melee weapons
- tu in character screen
