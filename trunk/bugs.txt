Issues:

Bugs:
- grey zone where previously seen
- trees show up in the wrong place
- alien doors not wide enough - block shots
- support drag in character screen
- door bugs, redo door system
- re-size after load?
? pauses when move - profiler?
- Art: better human models
- Art: better alien models
- Art: missing weapon models
- fire generates light
- mission types: crash
- check math (again) in PushShootAction()
- handle too many particles consistently
- mission types: landing
- mission types: terror
- mission types: big ufos
- mission types: base
- start at action (not black screen)
- add lander animation
- add morale
? psi attack
- add random sequence to low bits of random # gen

Architecture
- render managers
- AI objects 
- Map as interface
- Build in profiler.

TBD:
- tap accuracy
- Pinching doesn't feel right
- tutorial notes infrastructure
- performance: AI/Alien turn pauses
- unconscious
- eject shells
- Center engine view on clip, not full screen
- Reconsider when reaction fire occurs. And probability.
- performance: AI/Alien turn pauses
- phat loot / edge of map / exploration

FIXED
- improve gamui toggle buttons - when looking for a default button, prefer visible & enabled
- screen re-size / layout / device loss
- click and drag unit
- drawn edges of world
- give aliens auto-armor
- bug in AI memory. Need to moduarlize AI code.
- tune unit skills, accuracy, hp, levels
- tap tile to select unit
- highlight model, not just feet
- Arch: MicroGLUI separation
- need correct colors in RenderWeapon()
- move grid doesn't always update
- rotation clears path
- gameplay: rotation? reaction fire? need some advantage to flanking
- alien hp appearing off screen
- 'null' appears in secondary fire slot
- resolve armor vs. hp
- line of sight bugs

FIXED [test #2]
- Stats screen
- Results + EXP screen
- Pop location should never fail. (fixed enough.)
- Art: help notes
- Remove plants, go to trees.
- Change reaction rules to account rotation
- 'next' by proximity
- selection metaphor 
	- next/prev, click dest, click to fire?
	- unit icons? click to select in UI?
- gameplay
	- crouching?
	- rotation?
- End game at any point (instead of just on terran end-turn)
- Sounds
- map generation, tile rotation (YAY! - fixed coordinate system, fixed rotation...)
- Art: fix alien doors
- different maps
- proportional font
- center on hit unit
- AI: guard behavior
- Armor. Affects hp. Can't change in tactical view.
- AI: some random scout motion
- rework low ammo weapons, fix test game
- explosion not causing FoW update ???
- Couldn't figure out crosshair: UI wasn't clear (rely on help)
- showing too many particles (hide in FoW)
- can't see who is selected / Hard to tell who the currently selected unit is.
- Highlight looks stupid / intergrated button highlight (dark or light selected??)
- UI covers up target icons
- Fix: added distance check. explosive weapons should not reaction fire?? Or check for line of sight?
- move controls to their own bar.
- move clip to engine	
- reconsider button placement
- scaling
- separate UI
- rework low ammo weapons, fix test game
- explosive weapons should not reaction fire?? Or check for line of sight?
- fix issue with 2 aliens on same tile...
- don't allow moving off of edge of map
- account for aliens having better night vision in CalcVisibilityRay
- all aliens should be rank0 
- Alien HP too high / damage too low. Normalize traits.
- need victory / defeat screen
- call SetFogOfWar less (New visibility class defers as much calculation as possible)
- AI: moves too close
- better weapon accuracy calibration
- alien turn indicator
- AI: aliens not following LKP
- FoW not updating properly when moving? or pausing incorrect?
- Aliens come back to life! Or at least look that way.
- crates could be more descriptive in their images...
- hit point bar
- disable controls during alien turn

FIXED [test #1]
- center on selected unit (w/ scrolling?)
- reaction fire probability
- weapon (in)accuracy
- doors
- map destruction isn't causing re-vis and reaction.
- first unit in first slot doesn't seem to do damage correctly with rocket
- sort out when to clear / process Events
- reaction fire
- sort out CalcVis vs. CalcAllVis.
- fire - flammability
- smoke from explosive weapons
- smoke and fire effect visibility
- explosive weapons
- on object destroyed, re-calc visibility
- remove double delay on weapon blasts
- always fires primary weapon
- weird delay when map objects destroyed
- optimize CalcUnitVisibility() to look at a cone.
- map: check "view bounds" before invalidating a unit.

Deferred/Cancelled
- melee weapons
- tu in character screen
- simultaneous shots
- Sounds: better sounds, latency
- Gameplay: doors are death traps if guarded...blow up doors?
