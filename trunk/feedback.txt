[Cherie build 231]
- Need phat loot (should dead aliens just become stuff?)
- Tap accuracy. Scoots around. Be more forgiving?
- [done] sScroll jumping bug
- "shades of green" on the movement dots.
- Lee: Alien HP too high / damage too low
- Next turn indicator
- Lee: Rewards for exploring? Edge of map is...nothing.
- Aliens come back to life! Or at least look that way.
- Move should be faster.
- Doesn't alway go where wanted. Touch doesn't do anything. (More forgiving? Go to "feet move" model?)
- Pinching doesn't feel right
- [done] Lee: 30fps frame limit on the iPod
- [done] only pause on first alien spotted

[Jeff Build 230-ish]
- [done-removed for now] Confused by Next vs. Next Done
- [done] Time unit: confused by running
- Move dots were very clear
- Did not read any instructions
- Couldn't figure out crosshair: UI wasn't clear
- Tap troubles. Didn't think to zoom in.
- Terran weapons inaccurate
- [Lee] Needs tutorial mode
- [done - went 360] shadows chasing behind is weird - gray for stuff that has been seen before
- touch interface frustrating - large percentage doesn't work. Moves on you. [lee]Increase the "selection" area? Scroll also selects? Tap-move selects
- [done] Too many shooting options - 6 is too many

Main feedbacks:
- too hard to select people, disable "screen twitching"
- [done] too many shooting options
- [done] 3 buttons: Snap, Aimed, B-feature (Fast/Good/Blow Up)

Further idea:
- no changing numbers: HP, TU, Armor to interface
- [done] see in 360: fixes the "chasing darkness", simpler, gets rotation out
- [done] arrows to all targets all the time
