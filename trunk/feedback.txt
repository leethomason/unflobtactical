[Cherie build 231]
- Need phat loot (should dead aliens just become stuff?)
- Tap accuracy. Scoots around. Be more forgiving?
- [done] sScroll jumping bug
- "shades of green" on the movement dots.
- Lee: Alien HP too high / damage too low
- Next turn indicator
- Lee: Rewards for exploring? Edge of map is...nothing.
- Aliens come back to life! Or at least look that way.
- Move should be faster.
- Doesn't alway go where wanted. Touch doesn't do anything. (More forgiving? Go to "feet move" model?)
- Pinching doesn't feel right
- [done] Lee: 30fps frame limit on the iPod
- [done] only pause on first alien spotted
