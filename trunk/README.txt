Xenowar is a turned based strategy game for Win32 and Android OS (version 2.1 or higher.)

Xenowar is influenced by X-COM, the Android development, and casual games. The project started
out as an experiment to understand mobile GPUs on a mobile phone, and just became too 
interesting to not keep playing with. 

Enjoy!
