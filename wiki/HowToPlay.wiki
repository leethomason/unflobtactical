#an overview of how to play the tactical preview

= UFO Attack =

Welcome to UFO Attack! UFO Attack is a turned based tactical combat game. (It is based on the classic game X-COM, but has been changing as I write it and add new concepts. It's very rewarding to take the game in a bit of a new direction).

There are 2 teams: the Terran Soldiers and the Aliens. You play the Terrans, while the computer plays the Aliens.

== Current State ==

Only "1/2 a turn" is playable. The players moves your Terran units. The Aliens will sometime shoot back (reaction fire) but not ever move or attack.

=== Turns & Time ===

The game is played in turns. The player controls the Terran team.
  * Terran
  * Alien
  * Civilian

Each unit has a certain number of *Time Units (TU)*. Each time unit allows the unit to move one square of distance. Other actions (shooting, accessing inventory) take additional time units. TUs are replenished each turn.

==== Reaction Fire ====

During the enemy turn (Alien turn for the player) it is possible to have 'reaction fire'. Shooting that the Terrans can do during the Alien turn, if an Alien is spotted. Reaction fire is important so that you can defend your troops between turns.

Of course, the Aliens get reaction fire too.

=== Weapons ===

Every weapon in the game has:
  * Aimed fire mode. More accurate, but takes more time.
  * Snap fire mode. Uses few TUs, but less accurate.

Some weapons also have:
  * Auto fire mode. Fires a burst of 3 shots. Usually the most effective fire mode, if the weapon supports it.

All weapons have a primary mode. Some weapons have a secondary fire mode as well - generally a grenade launcher or incendiary attack.

Here are the Terran weapons, where "dam" is the based damage (20) followed by chance to hit (27%) and 'damage per time unit' (2.3)

  * CANON: mini canon. Secondary fire is incendiary.

Terran weapons use various kinds of shells. All alien weapons run off plasma cells.
