= UFO Attack =

Updated for build 360.

Welcome to UFO Attack! UFO Attack is a turned based tactical combat game. It is based on the classic game X-COM, but has been changing as I write it and add new concepts. It's very rewarding to take the game in a bit of a new direction.

There are 2 teams: the Terran Soldiers and the Aliens. You play the Terrans, while the computer plays the Aliens.

== Your Help Needed! ==

Suggestions, input, ideas, bugs, all feedback is appreciated! 

The best way is to submit an Issue: http://code.google.com/p/unflobtactical/issues/list

But you can comment on the wiki, edit the wiki (email me for access), or send me feedback on email. Thanks in advance - getting other people involved is very appreciated.

== Art Direction ==

The art is still in development. The units (terran and alien) are all placeholder, although the buildings and some icons are getting there. My current thinking is to give it a "cartoony board game" look. Largely this is driven by not wanting to put in an animation system, and trying to keep the art requirements do-able. I'm still happy to get any ideas or feedback on the art, of course.

== Current State ==

The tactical game is fully playable. Only a "Farm" scenario is currently available, but basic functionality, AI, and gameplay are in place.

== Android ==

In development!

== iPod Version ==

The iPod version is retired, although the code is still in the source tree. Apple's draconian policy has pushed me over the edge. Go Android!

== PC Version ==

Left mouse button: click to select or tap buttons. Drag to move the camera.

Right mouse button: drag to zoom and rotate.

Pressing the "escape" key exits.

Note that you can only select units with the arrows keys - on screen or on your keyboard. Click to select works pretty well on the PC, but is unusable on a device. UI suggestions welcome, but it all has to work on the Nexus One.

== Concepts ==

=== Turns & Time ===

The game is played in turns. The player controls the Terran team.
  * Terran
  * Alien
  * Civilian

Each unit has a certain number of *Time Units (TU)*. Each time unit allows the unit to move one square of distance. Other actions (shooting, accessing inventory) take additional time units. TUs are replenished each turn.

==== Reaction Fire ====

During the enemy turn (Alien turn for the player) it is possible to have 'reaction fire'. Shooting that the Terrans can do during the Alien turn, if an Alien is spotted. Reaction fire is important so that you can defend your troops between turns.

Of course, the Aliens get reaction fire too.

The only time rotation matters in the game is for reaction fire. The more a unit has to turn, the less accurate the reaction will be.

=== Sight and Fog of War ===

Every unit has a 360 degree range of vision. The map is revealed everywhere a team can see. Everything else is in the "fog of war" and rendered in black.

Nighttime significantly reduces the Terran vision. Aliens are less affected, but still impacted. Fire and smoke obscures vision.

Doors are never locked; you can always walk through doors. They close behind you.

=== Weapons ===

Weapons in the game have different fire modes. Each is different, but broadly speaking:
  * A fast fire mode, low accuracy.
  * A burst fire (3 shots), or aimed mode, high accuracy.
  * An alternate fire mode - incendiary or explosive.

Designations:
  * PST: pistol
  * AR: Assault Rifles. Like all designations, the AR-2 is better than and replaces the AR-1. Weapons variants are designated AR-3P (pulse rifle) and AR-3L (long range AR).
  * CANON: mini canon. Secondary fire is incendiary.

Alien weapons have different designations. Ammo is automatically loaded - by having the ammo in your inventory it will be used. More powerful weapons can destroy buildings and the landscape, and occasionally will start fires.

== Interface ==





=== Selected Unit ===

*Possible destinations are highlighted on the map.* Tap to travel there. Destinations in
  * Green leaves enough TUs for *auto* reaction fire.
  * Yellow leaves enough TUs for *snap* reaction fire.
  * Orange means the unit has insufficient time for reaction fire.

*Alien units* tap any alien units to bring up the fire menu. You can target any alien, but aliens marked with a red reticule are line of sight to the current unit.

=== Status Bar at Top ===

The text across the top of the page gives information on the selected character.
  * Rank. As the unit increases in rank, his/her TUs, HP, Accuracy, and Reaction Fire all improve. The ranks are:
   * Rookie
   * Private
   * Sargent
   * Major
   * Captain
   * Commander
  * Name
  * TU: Time Units remaining this turn
  * HP: Health remaining
  * TGT: X/Y. Alien targets. The first number is the number of alien this unit can see, the 2nd number is all the alien units spotted by the Terrans.

=== Left Buttons ===
  * EXIT. The lander takes off, leaving behind anyone not on-board. Not yet implemented.
  * 'O' Ends the turn.
  * 'N' Selects the next unit.
  * 'ND' Selects the next unit, and Next/NextDone won't reselect this unit again. (Although you can always tap on it to select.)
  * Target allows you to fire at an arbitrary location on the map. Tap the Target icon and then the map location.

=== Right Buttons ===
  * Character screen. Tap to manage inventory or pick up items on the world map.
  * Left / Right. Turn the selected unit.

  * *Left is the primary* fire mode. The right column secondary.
  * Top buttons are the info about the fire mode. Damage (D50) and Rounds remaining (R15). Aimed and snap shots take 1 round. Auto shots take 3.
  * In the columns info is displayed for each shot type. Chance to hit (22%), TUs required (4.0), and the Damage Per TU (2.7).
   * Aimed
   * Auto
   * Snap

This is the character inventory screen. On the left side is what the selected unit is carrying. On the right are items on the ground.

=== Carried (left) Items ===
Items in green are in the unit's backpack. The left red item is armor worn. The right red item is the weapon in hand. The center red icon is the "unload" and will pull the clips and grenades out of the current weapon.

You can load a weapon by placing it in a hand and dragging ammo on to it. For weapons with secondary fire, the primary rounds are on the left, and the secondary on the right.

=== Inventory (right) Items ===
The left (blue) column selects the groups of items to view.
  * Miscellaneous and alien items
  * Armor
  * Alien Weapons
  * Terran Weapons
You can drag between the items on the ground (green) and items in your backpack.
