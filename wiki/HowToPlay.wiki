#an overview of how to play the tactical preview

= UFO Attack =

Welcome to UFO Attack! UFO Attack is a turned based tactical combat game. (It is based on the classic game X-COM, but has been changing as I write it and add new concepts. It's very rewarding to take the game in a bit of a new direction).

There are 2 teams: the Terran Soldiers and the Aliens. You play the Terrans, while the computer plays the Aliens.

== Current State ==

Only "1/2 a turn" is playable. The players moves your Terran units. The Aliens will sometime shoot back (reaction fire) but not ever move or attack.

== Concepts ==

=== Turns & Time ===

The game is played in turns. The player controls the Terran team.
* Terran
* Alien
* Civilian

Each unit has a certain number of *Time Units (TU)*. Each time unit allows the unit to move one square of distance. Other actions (shooting, accessing inventory) take additional time units. TUs are replenished each turn.

=== Weapons ===

Every weapon in the game has:
* Aimed fire mode. More accurate, but takes more time.
* Snap fire mode. Uses few TUs, but less accurate.

Some weapons also have:
* Auto fire mode. Fires a burst of 3 shots. Usually the most effective fire mode, if the weapon supports it.

All weapons have a primary mode. Some weapons have a secondary fire mode as well - generally a grenade launcher or incendiary attack.
