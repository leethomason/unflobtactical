#an overview of how to play the tactical preview

= UFO Attack =

Welcome to UFO Attack! UFO Attack is a turned based tactical combat game. It is based on the classic game X-COM, but has been changing as I write it. There are 2 teams: the Terran Soldiers and the Aliens. You play the Terrans, while the computer plays the Aliens.

== Current State ==

Only "1/2 a turn" is playable. You can move your Terran units. The Aliens will sometime shoot back (reaction fire) but not ever move or attack.
