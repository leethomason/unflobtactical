Build 346

Welcome to UFO Attack! UFO Attack is a turned based tactical combat game. (It is based on the classic game X-COM, but has been changing as I write it and add new concepts. It's very rewarding to take the game in a bit of a new direction).

There are 2 teams: the Terran Soldiers and the Aliens. You play the Terrans, while the computer plays the Aliens.

== Your Help Needed! ==

Suggestions, input, ideas, bugs, all feedback is appreciated! 

The best way is to submit an Issue: http://code.google.com/p/unflobtactical/issues/list

But you can comment on the wiki, edit the wiki (email me for access), or send me feedback on email. Thanks in advance - getting other people involved is very appreciated.

== Art Direction ==

Much of the art is missing. There are few icons, only a couple of weapon models, and most of the art is placeholder. My current thinking is to give it a "cartoony board game" look. Largely this is driven by not wanting to put in an animation system, and trying to keep the art requirements do-able. I'm still happy to get any ideas or feedback on the art, of course. It's in a good place to think about new ideas since I'll re-do it anyway.

== Current State ==

The tactical game is fully playable. Only a "Farm" scenario is currently available, but basic functionality, AI, and gameplay are in place.

== Android ==

In development!

== iPod Version ==

The iPod version is retired, although the code is still in the source tree. Apple's draconian policy has pushed me over the edge. Go Android!

== PC Version ==

Left mouse button: click to select or tap buttons. Drag to move the camera.

Right mouse button: drag to zoom and rotate.

Pressing the "escape" key exits.

== Concepts ==

=== Turns & Time ===

The game is played in turns. The player controls the Terran team.
  * Terran
  * Alien
  * Civilian

Each unit has a certain number of *Time Units (TU)*. Each time unit allows the unit to move one square of distance. Other actions (shooting, accessing inventory) take additional time units. TUs are replenished each turn.

==== Reaction Fire ====

During the enemy turn (Alien turn for the player) it is possible to have 'reaction fire'. Shooting that the Terrans can do during the Alien turn, if an Alien is spotted. Reaction fire is important so that you can defend your troops between turns.

Of course, the Aliens get reaction fire too.

=== Sight and Fog of War ===

Every unit has a 360 degree range of vision. The map is revealed everywhere a team can see. Everything else is in the "fog of war" and rendered in black.

Nighttime significantly reduces the Terran vision. (Aliens are less affected.) Fire and smoke obscures vision.

Doors are never locked; you can always walk through doors. They close behind you.

=== Weapons ===

Every weapon in the game has:
  * Aimed fire mode. More accurate, but takes more time.
  * Snap fire mode. Uses few TUs, but less accurate.

Some weapons also have:
  * Auto fire mode. Fires a burst of 3 shots. Usually the most effective fire mode, if the weapon supports it.

All weapons have a primary mode. Some weapons have a secondary fire mode as well - generally a grenade launcher or incendiary attack.

Here are the Terran weapons, where "dam" is the based damage (20) followed by chance to hit (27%) and 'damage per time unit' (2.3)

  * PST: pistol
  * AR: Assault Rifles. Like all designations, the AR-2 is better than and replaces the AR-1. Weapons variants are designated AR-3P (pulse rifle) and AR-3L (long range AR).
  * RKT: Rocket laucher (may get re-done)
  * CANON: mini canon. Secondary fire is incendiary.

Terran weapons use various kinds of shells. All alien weapons run off plasma cells.

More powerful weapons can destroy buildings and the landscape, and occasionally will start fires.

=== Selected Unit ===

*Possible destinations are highlighted on the map.* Tap to travel there. Destinations in
  * Green leaves enough TUs for *auto* reaction fire.
  * Yellow leaves enough TUs for *snap* reaction fire.

  * 'O' Ends the turn.

This is the character inventory screen. On the left side is what the selected unit is carrying. On the right are items on the ground.

=== Carried (left) Items ===
Items in green are in the unit's backpack. The left red item is armor worn. The right red item is the weapon in hand. The center red icon is the "unload" and will pull the clips and grenades out of the current weapon.

You can load a weapon by placing it in a hand and dragging ammo on to it. For weapons with secondary fire, the primary rounds are on the left, and the secondary on the right.

=== Inventory (right) Items ===
The left (blue) column selects the groups of items to view.
  * Miscellaneous and alien items
  * Armor
  * Alien Weapons
  * Terran Weapons
You can drag between the items on the ground (green) and items in your backpack.
