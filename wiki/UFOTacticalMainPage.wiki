UFO Tactical (working title) is a turned based strategy game for the iPhone. It is influenced by X-COM and the iPhone interface. The game also runs on the PC.

It started out as an experiment to understand mobile GPUs on a mobile phone, and just became too interesting to not keep playing with.

UFO Tactical is in early development. It is not yet playable.
