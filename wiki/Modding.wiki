#How to mod xenowar

= Introduction =

This is a very early process. If mods and art becomes available, this process can be streamlined.

= Using a Mod =

Currently PC Only.

  # Get a uforesource.db data file.
  # Open your xenowar directory.
  # Go into the res directory.
  # rename uforesource.db to uforesource.db.bak so you can recover it later
  # Put in the new uforesource.db
  # Start the game - you have new resources!

= Creating a Mod = 

Note: although you need the full source code, you *do not* need to build from source. Most of the source code is the art assets, so it's easier to pull down the source base than to pack it all up.

== Get the Source ==

Do an anonymous source checkout. The command line, and tools you can use, are documented here:

http://code.google.com/p/unflobtactical/source/checkout

Setting up SVN is straightforward, but the time consuming part. Once you have SVN, it's easy to pull down the source code base.

== Build a Resource File ==

If you want to create your own mod, you must first be able to build the resource file the game uses.

  # From the downloads page on the unflobtactical site, download the ufobuilder.zip file.
  # Extract its contents into the top of the source tree. So if your extracted the source to c:\src\unflobtactical-read-only, the ufobuilder.exe file should be at c:\src\unflobtactical-read-only\ufobuilder.exe
  # Make the subdirectory 'res'. (c:\src\unflobtactical-read-only\res\
)
  # From the command line, run buildres.bat
  # Lots of output; should generate the uforesource.db file in the res directory.
